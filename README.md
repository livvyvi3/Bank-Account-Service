## Overview

### The challenge
- implement Withdrawal and deposit functionality for a bank that has two types of accounts.
- bank has a current and savings account types. 
- to apply business logic for a current account and savings account.

### My Process 
- built my console application on .Net6 
- made use of Singleton design pattern for implementing my database and Dependancy injection 
-
### Built with
.Net6

### What I learned
  This challenge has helped me improve my coding skills, problem solving and research methods for building real world projects. I learnt how to create an interface, and implement one.
  Research on Singleton design pattern as well and implementing a dummy database using dependancy injection, and following OOP principles. 
  
### Continued development
  A great way to continue with my learning would be being mentored around .Net framework under the wing of a professional and contributing towards working systems.
  
  
### Useful resources
- [Dependency injection](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/ioc/dependency-injection) - This helped me to creating my database.
- [Sinleton design patterns](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/singleton-design-pattern/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Singleton design patterns. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning its concept.
- [Interface](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-interface) - This helped me to creating my Account Services and Database interfaces.

I have made use of other youtube channels, which were short and easy to follow through.
